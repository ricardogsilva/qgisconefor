??? info "Extra - Installing from our custom plugin repo"
In addition to installing from the official QGIS plugin repository, this plugin is also available for install from 
our own custom plugin repo. This may occasionally have a newer version
than the one present in the official QGIS repo (the reason being that the QGIS repo is manually curated and it
usually takes a while before a new version is approved by its maintainers)

    It is available at:
    
    <https://ricardogsilva.github.io/qgisconefor/repo/plugins.xml>
    
    1. Add this custom repository inside QGIS Plugin Manager
    1. Refresh the list of available plugins
    1. Search for a plugin named **Conefor**
    1. Install it!
